    "text": "The code in this script creates the cohort of kidney transplant patients eligible for the study for use in other scripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n\n\nThe full R script is available at:\n\nR/create_cohort.R\n\nThis R script file is itself reliant on the following helper files:\n\nR/setup.R\nR/functions.R\n\n\n\n\n\nThis portion of the code imports files from the USRDS data set necessary for the cryptococcus analysis. This portion makes use of the load_usrds_data() function from the usRds package as well as several tidyverse cleaning functions.\nKey files used:\n\npatients: This is a part of the Core data set of the USRDS and contains key patient demographics.\ntx: Also a part of the Core data set of the USRDS and contains summary information about kidney transplants from UNOS.\ntxunos_trr_ki and txunos_trr_kp: Part of the transplant data set of the USRDS, these files contain more detailed information derived from UNOS that is part of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.\n\nThe code below loads and merges transplant records across multiple UNOS-derived files, constructs a cumulative transplant count per patient, and reshapes the data into a time-varying format that tracks graft status over time.\n\n\nCode\n#Import core demographics from \"patients\" file\npatients_raw&lt;-usRds::load_usrds_file(\"patients\")%&gt;%\n  select(-ZIPCODE) #This is ZIP code at time of USRDS initiation, but we want at time of crypto dx\n\n#Import key information about the transplants from the TX and UNOS databases\ntx_raw&lt;-usRds::load_usrds_file(\"tx\")%&gt;%\n  select(USRDS_ID, TDATE, FAILDATE, TRR_ID_CODE)\n\nki_raw&lt;-usRds::load_usrds_file(\"txunos_trr_ki\")%&gt;%\n  select(USRDS_ID, ORGTYP, HRTX, LUTX, INTX, LITX,PITX,BMTX, TRR_ID_CODE)\n\nkp_raw&lt;-usRds::load_usrds_file(\"txunos_trr_kp\")%&gt;%\n  select(USRDS_ID, ORGTYP, HRTX, LUTX, INTX, LITX,PITX,BMTX, TRR_ID_CODE)\n\n#This combines the three datasets\ntx_clean&lt;-tx_raw%&gt;%\n  left_join(bind_rows(ki_raw,\n                      kp_raw))%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, TDATE)%&gt;%\n  \n  group_by(USRDS_ID)%&gt;%\n  mutate(cumulative_transplant_total=row_number())%&gt;%\n  ungroup\n\n#Create a time-varying dataset that can be used to track whether a pt has an active or inactive graft and the cumulative number of txs\ntx_status&lt;-tx_clean%&gt;%\n  select(USRDS_ID, TDATE, FAILDATE, cumulative_transplant_total)%&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(TDATE, FAILDATE),\n    names_to = \"event_type\",\n    values_to = \"event_date\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(event_date)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    graft_status = case_when(\n      event_type == \"TDATE\" ~ \"Active\",\n      event_type == \"FAILDATE\" ~ \"Failed\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  select(-event_type)%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, cumulative_transplant_total, event_date, graft_status)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next component makes use of the flowchart package. This package combines two key processes in an epidemiologic analysis:\n\nDataset preparation: Sequential application of eligibility criteria to define the analytic cohort, with explicit tracking of excluded records at each step.\nSTROBE(https://www.strobe-statement.org/) diagram preparation: STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology STROBE diagrams visually depict the process of including/excluding patients in an observational study and grouping them into cohorts. Many journals require these as a standard Figure 1.\n\nThe code below initializes a flowchart-aware cohort object and applies sequential eligibility filters, retaining both inclusion counts and labeled exclusion steps for downstream reporting.\n\n\nCode\n#Initialize a flowchart cohort\npatients_clean&lt;-patients_raw%&gt;%\n  as_fc(label=\"Patients in USRDS\")%&gt;%\n  \n  \n  fc_filter(TOTTX&gt;0, \n            label=\"Prior transplant\", \n            label_exc = \"Excluded: No prior transplant\", \n            show_exc = TRUE)%&gt;%\n  \n  fc_filter(TX1DATE&lt;as.Date(\"2021-01-01\"), \n            label=\"Transplant prior to 2021\", \n            label_exc = \"Excluded: Transplant 2021 or later\", \n            show_exc = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis component identifies baseline comorbidities among transplant recipients using diagnosis codes derived from Medicare Institutional (Part A) and physician/supplier (Part B) claims. Diagnosis code lists defined in R/setup.R are applied uniformly across claims files to establish the presence and timing of comorbid conditions.\nThis portion makes use of the get_IN_ICD() and get_PS_ICD() functions from the usRds package to obtain dates that specific ICD codes are used for patients with a history of at least one kidney transplant in the study period.\nThe establish_dx_date() function from the usRds package uses the results of this analysis to ascertain the date when comorbidities meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis:\n\nTwo outpatient encounters or\nOne inpatient encounter\n\nIn parallel, Medicare coverage history is retrieved for all transplant recipients from the payhist file, which is part of the Core dataest. These data will be used to confirm continuous enrollment during the analytic period. We verify the absence of gaps indicating missing data, noting that every subsequent period in the dataset for a patient starts the day after the previous period ends and thereby supporting valid longitudinal assessment of diagnoses and downstream cost analyses.\nFinally, we separate cryptococcus diagnosis dates from other comorbidities for a separate list, given the key nature of the date of cryptococcus diagnosis for subsequent analyses.\n\n\nCode\n#Create list of USRDS ids for patients who have undergone transplant\ntransplant_id_list&lt;-patients_clean$data%&gt;%\n  pull(USRDS_ID)\n\n# We now seek to determine comorbidities by using diagnosis codes from the setup.R file\n\ncomorbidity_diagnosis_date&lt;-list()\n\n# Combine all ICD codes from all comorbidities into one list \ncomorbidity_ICD_combined_list&lt;-unlist(comorbidity_ICD_list, use.names=FALSE)\n\n#Scrape files for any comorbidity claim\ncomorbidity_claims_df&lt;-bind_rows(get_IN_ICD(icd_codes = comorbidity_ICD_combined_list, \n                                            years = 2006:2021, \n                                            usrds_ids = transplant_id_list ),\n                                 get_PS_ICD(icd_codes = comorbidity_ICD_combined_list, \n                                            years = 2006:2021, \n                                            usrds_ids = transplant_id_list )%&gt;%rename(CODE=DIAG))%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, CLM_FROM)\n\n#Create comorbidity_diagnosis_date data frame\nfor (comorbidity in names(comorbidity_ICD_list)){\n  \n  comorbidity_diagnosis_date[[comorbidity]]&lt;-comorbidity_claims_df%&gt;%\n    filter(CODE %in% comorbidity_ICD_list[[comorbidity]])%&gt;%\n    establish_dx_date(diagnosis_established = comorbidity)\n}\n\n#Load Medicare coverage history for all patients with transplant\nmedicare_history&lt;-load_usrds_file(\"payhist\",\n                                  usrds_ids = transplant_id_list)%&gt;%\n  arrange(USRDS_ID, BEGDATE)%&gt;%\n  group_by(USRDS_ID)%&gt;%\n  mutate(lag_ENDDATE=lag(ENDDATE))%&gt;%\n  mutate(gap=as.numeric(BEGDATE-lag_ENDDATE))%&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(gap))\n\n#Confirm no gaps (gap should always be 1 or missing)\nif (any(!is.na(medicare_history$gap) & medicare_history$gap != 1)) {\n  stop(\"Gap assumption violated: `gap` contains values other than 1 or NA.\")\n}\n\n\n#Format a df with the cryptococcus dx\ncryptococcus_df&lt;-comorbidity_diagnosis_date$cryptococcus%&gt;%\n  select(-diagnosis)%&gt;%\n  rename(cryptococcus_dx_date=date_established)\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsequently, key diagnosis dates, including the date of cryptococcosis diagnosis, are merged into the analytic patient dataset.\nThis code block then extends the STROBE flowchart by integrating diagnosis timing, eligibility criteria, and coverage requirements to finalize the analytic cohorts. Patients are classified as cryptococcosis cases or potential controls based on the presence and timing of diagnosis, and sequential exclusion criteria are applied to ensure incident disease, adult status at diagnosis, and appropriate calendar-time eligibility.\nThe verify_medicare_primary() function from the usrds package is used to confirm that patients with a cryptococcus diagnosis have Medicare primary coverage for at least 365 days prior to the cryptococcus diagnosis date to ensure that the diagnosis is new and not a carryover from an unobserved period.\nThese steps culminate in the final case and control cohorts, with all inclusion and exclusion decisions explicitly tracked and visualized in the updated STROBE flow diagram.\n\n\nCode\n#Join cryptococcus date to fc cohort\npatients_clean$data&lt;-left_join(patients_clean$data, \n                               cryptococcus_df)%&gt;%\n  mutate(cryptococcus_case=ifelse(is.na(cryptococcus_dx_date), \"Potential control\", \"Case\"))\n\n#Continue to create analytic cohort\npatients_merged&lt;-patients_clean%&gt;%\n  \n  #Remove patients with a diagnosis of cryptococcus prior to transplant\n  fc_filter(cryptococcus_dx_date&gt;TX1DATE | is.na(cryptococcus_dx_date), \n            label=\"No cryptococcus dx prior to transplant\", \n            label_exc = \"Excluded: cryptococcus dx prior to transplant\", \n            show_exc = TRUE)%&gt;%\n  \n  fc_filter((time_length(interval(BORN, cryptococcus_dx_date), \"years\") &gt;= 18) | is.na(cryptococcus_dx_date),\n            label=\"Age 18+ at time of cryptococcus if cryptococcus patient\", \n            label_exc = \"Excluded: First cryptococcus prior to age 18\", \n            show_exc = TRUE)%&gt;%\n  \n  fc_filter((year(cryptococcus_dx_date)&gt;=2007 & year(cryptococcus_dx_date)&lt;=2020) | is.na(cryptococcus_dx_date),\n            label=\"Incident cryptococcus between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2020\", \n            label_exc = \"Incident cryptococcus outside of specified date range\", \n            show_exc = TRUE)%&gt;%\n  \n  #Split cohorts\n  fc_split(cryptococcus_case)\n  \n  #Check Medicare coverage for 365-day lookback period from day of first episode of cryptococcus\npatients_merged$data&lt;-patients_merged$data%&gt;%\n  verify_medicare_primary(index_date = \"cryptococcus_dx_date\",\n                          lookback_days = 365,\n                          coverage_start_variable = \"coverage_start_date\",\n                          coverage_end_variable = \"coverage_end_date\"\n                          )%&gt;%\n  mutate(medicare_primary_TF=ifelse(cryptococcus_case==\"Potential control\", TRUE, medicare_primary_TF))\n  \npatients_merged2&lt;-patients_merged%&gt;%\n  \n  fc_filter(medicare_primary_TF==TRUE, \n            label = \"365+ days of Medicare primary coverage\\nprior to first cryptococcus claim\", \n            label_exc = \"Excluded: Fewer than 365 days of coverage\",\n            show_exc = TRUE)\n\npatients_merged2$data&lt;-patients_merged2$data%&gt;%\n  select(-medicare_primary_TF)%&gt;%\n  \n  #Prepare data for cohort initialization\n  mutate(terminal_date=coalesce(coverage_end_date, censor_date))\n\npatients_merged2&lt;-patients_merged2%&gt;%\n  fc_filter((terminal_date - cryptococcus_dx_date &gt;=minimum_followup) | is.na(cryptococcus_dx_date), \n            label = \"Minimum followup exceeded\", \n            label_exc= \"Excluded: Minimum follow-up threshold not met\",\n            show_exc = TRUE)\n\n  \npatients_merged2%&gt;%\n  fc_draw()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use several functions from the usRds package:\n\ncreate_usrds_cohort()\nadd_cohort_covariate()\nfinalize_usrds_cohort()\n\nThese functions split each patient into multiple rows, with each row describing a discrete period of time. This captures that patients will have time-varying status for covariates such as cirrhosis status, etc.\nPatients with cryptococcus infection join the cohort on the date of cryptococcosis diagnosis, while patients without cryptococcus (potential controls) join on the date of their first kidney transplant.\n“Time since transplant” resets after each new transplant.\n\n\nCode\n#Now we need to construct the time-varying data set\n\n#Ungroup\ninitial_cohort&lt;-patients_merged2$data%&gt;%\n  ungroup()%&gt;%\n\n#Cases join when they experience cryptococcus\n#Controls start on date of first transplant\n  mutate(\n    cohort_join_date = coalesce(\n      as.Date(cryptococcus_dx_date),\n      as.Date(TX1DATE)\n    )\n  )\n\n#Initialize cohort\nprematching_cohort&lt;-create_usrds_cohort(df=initial_cohort,\n                            start_date = \"cohort_join_date\",\n                            end_date = \"terminal_date\")%&gt;%\n  \n  #
