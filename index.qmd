## Clinical background

[Cryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/12/5/ofaf263/8121609) is uncommon but potentially catastrophic. When [transmission occurs through the donor](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8096655/), it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.

The costs of cryptococcus after solid organ transplant are unclear.  Although studies have quantified the cost of a single hospitalization for cryptococcus,
no study to date has estimated the total excess cost of care due to cryptococcus.

## What this analysis does

This project uses the [**United States Renal Data System**](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/about-niddk/strategic-plans-reports/usrds) to analyze the 



## Methods

We selected cryptococcus cases based on the following inclusion criteria:

- Age 18 or greater
- Prior kidney transplant
- ICD9 or ICD10 codes for cryptococcus (2 outpatient or 1 inpatient)
- One year of Medicare primary coverage lead-in

Controls were matched 2:1 to cases based on risk-set sampling on the following:

- Time since transplant
- Cirrhosis
- Diabetes
- HIV/AIDS
- Age within 10 years
- Sampling date for control within 3 years of sampling date for case

Institutional claims data were abstracted as well as Physician/Supplier line-item data.

### Reproducibility

All analyses presented on this website are fully reproducible.  

The complete source code used to generate the decision trees, sensitivity analyses, and figures is publicly available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/VagishHemmige/Cryptococcus-cost-analysis).  The R script `R/main.R` will run the R subscripts needed for this analysis in the order they are to be run.  Model assumptions, parameter values, and analytic workflows are documented in the repository to facilitate transparency and reuse.
