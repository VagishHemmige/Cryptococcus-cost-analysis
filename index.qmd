## Clinical background

[Cryptococcosis in kidney transplant recipients](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/12/5/ofaf263/8121609) is uncommon but potentially catastrophic. When [transmission occurs through the donor](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8096655/), it often presents early after transplant, may involve the central nervous system, and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite treatment.

The costs of cryptococcus after solid organ transplant are unclear.  Although studies have quantified the cost of a single hospitalization for cryptococcus,
no study to date has estimated the total excess cost of care due to cryptococcus.

## What this analysis does

### Reproducibility

All analyses presented on this website are fully reproducible.  

The complete source code used to generate the decision trees, sensitivity analyses, and figures is publicly available at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/VagishHemmige/Cryptococcus-cost-analysis).  The R script `R/main.R` will run the R subscripts needed for this analysis in the order they are to be run.  Model assumptions, parameter values, and analytic workflows are documented in the repository to facilitate transparency and reuse.
