The goal of Cryptococcus cost analysis is to understand the cost
implications of cryptococcal disease after kidney transplant. This
analysis utilizes the United States Renal Data System, which integrates
UNOS and Medicare data for post-transplant patients in the United

This analysis is currently in progress.
